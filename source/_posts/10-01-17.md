It is not easy to control, if you want to be relaxed. Efficiency always comes with anxiety. Try to make you tired in the early time and relax yourself before you go to bed. Temporarily,  I decided to pause my app development, but focus on my job. To learn English and remember Key words in job. Spent some time to read the jira task, code review, emails and chime. I need get familiar with the system as soon as possible so that I can have the ability to solve the problem.
