I am not sure if I am a guy who will love, strictly saying, like every girl who I would love to talk with, especially a girl whose family background is super better than mine.

I just hope I will never thought this kind of tihng, but things really come into my mind. It makes me feel guity but I cannot resist to think about it.

If man is a kind of animal who won't feel guilty when cheating in a relationship, then I am not a pure man. I feel strong guilty even when these things came into my mind.

However, I have to make myself calm and make a final decision.

Let's talk about these two girls, their pros and cons.

Girl A:

Pros:

1. Longer time relationship. Know better with each other
2. Came from the same place
3. Love to play and no ambition

Cons:

1. Too lazy, too dirty. Cannot provide a better environment to children
2. Zero ambition and cannot support me to do anything
3. Spend too much time on playing
4. Do not have enough money and depends on my family to support me on buying a house

Girl B:

Pros:

1. Younger
2. Family is rich
3. Has more skills and stronger ability
4. Good taste
5. Can provide a better environment to children

Cons:

1. Not know each other too much
2. Spend too much money(actually I like this one, it should be a pro)
3. Too short
4. Not good looking
