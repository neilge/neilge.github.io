Honestly, I don't like the roles who alway think they represent the justice and look down on others who differ from them. 

Jack Ryan is one of such guys whom I detested, even though I know what he did is the correct. In this world, right thing is not always useful and their poor honour is just a joke in the other world. If it is not him who was born as a white man and in U.S., he might not live long enough to say such words.
