Bitcoin is word that I heard frequently recent years, but I always do not have a chance to know what it is and how it works. At first I thoguth it is a "Geek Currency", but after I watch some videos and read some articles, finally I found I am wrong, totally wrong. Bitcoin or blockchian more procisely, is a future technology, especially in fiancial or economic field. Nowadays, we store our money into banks, which is a centralized agency. We need to certificate ourself to get our own money. But with Bitcoins or other blockchain currency, our money is always in our hand and we do not need a third party cencorship agency to keep a look on our property or assets. 

In fact, blockchain is not only about curreny but can be appied into many other usage. The basic idea of blockchain is decentralization. There is no database to store the data and no central server to run the code. We can know something from the self-description of Ethereum, a new rising blockchain:

> Ethereum is a  decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.

Blockchain is a big revolution for the next generation of internet and some people love to call it WEB 3.0. 

I decided to dive myself into this field and learn things as fast as I can, so that I can catch up with this tide.
