Yesterday is our team out day. We went to top golf to play.

I figured out several things.

1. Marygrace is called Chen Sixuan and she lives in Grove St. in Jersey City
2. Ashish comes from North India.
3. Almost all of India movies have music and dance. And the music India are always coming along with movies.
4. James loves beatles?


experience:

1. I got the highest score: 50
2. Interesting to play
3. Top golf is different from golf. We stand on one side of the court and kick the ball to the wholes in the court. Every whole has its score and, even though, I have not figure out the way to calculate the score, the thing that I am sure is that the farther you can kick the ball, the higher score you can get.
