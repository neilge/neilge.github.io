I learnt a lot today.

For work, I start to go through the tutorial of horizonte which I think should be useful to figure out how to create a springmvc project from scratch and test things on this project. I also learn some basic concept about version set and LDAP. At the last of the work time, I also shadow oncall with vishal and learn how to get server log, what is coral, how to solve a problem with other teams.  

Another things is I figure out my way to get profit from etherum. There are some rules:

1. Do not be greedy and 1.25% profit is enough for one day
2. Do not set limit before you go to sleep becaues you will never know where the price will go
3. Do one transaction per day to avoid waste too much time on it.
4. When you decide to do a transaction, be sure it would be a low point on the graph
5. For now, for those ether that are losing money, don't sell them until they earn money

Finally, I got some kin, 12 ETH kin. Thanks for Hao Pan to bug this for me, because I do not have a registered account.
