    <content type="text"><![CDATA[What is Blockchian and BitcoinBitcoin is word that I heard frequently recent years, but I always do not have a chance to know what it is and how it works. At first I thoguth it is a “Geek Currency”, but after I watch some videos and read some articles, finally I found I am wrong, totally wrong. Bitcoin or blockchian more procisely, is a future technology, especially in fiancial or economic field. Nowadays, we store our money into banks, which is a centralized agency. We need to certificate ourself to get our own money. But with Bitcoins or other blockchain currency, our money is always in our hand and we do not need a third party cencorship agency to keep a look on our property or assets. In fact, blockchain is not only about curreny but can be appied into many other usage. The basic idea of blockchain is decentralization. There is no database to store the data and no central server to run the code. We can know something from the self-description of Ethereum, a new rising blockchain: Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. Blockchain is a big revolution for the next generation of internet and some people love to call it WEB 3.0. I decided to dive myself into this field and learn things as fast as I can, so that I can catch up with this tide. Here are some useful website to spike:Glossary of blockchain]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The good news is I finished setting up my personal tech blog using github.io and hexo. Finally, I have a safe place to put my knowledge and my experience in and the most awesome place is I can share my idea with others through this place. Hexo is awesome. I do not need to buy any server on cloud to deploy my code or buy database to store my data. Hexo helps me to avoid all these annoy things just by some simple cli and a github.io. Hexo also has varied themes and I choose the top1 pop theme called next. It is really elegant but powerful. I can change the highlight style of the code, add tagscloud and add a search function into it.But this is the end of good things. I have more troubles need to worry about. My time is limit but my tasks are accumulating and I did not find a sign that my work efficiency is improving. In fact, my issues can be concluded into two categories. One is communication problem, the other is skill problem. Communication is tough in a English speaking environment. I expected it would be hard, but I never thought it would be like this way. My listening becomes the most serious problem, because in many cases, I cannot understand what others are talking about and I need to guess what do they mean. The atomersphere of conversation become awkard just because I cannot understand what others are talking about and cannot get involved into the conversation. I hope my listening could be better by watching the TV shows and listening to Audible. But until now, the effect might not seems like much. I need to find a more efficient way to improve my speaking and listening. The other thing is my work efficiency is not as I expected. Not only because I spent too much time on setting up AUIserver, but I always feel tired when I just worked for a short of time. I think need more physical practice and get used to work in a long time. The other thing I can do is to remember some details in work or life intentionally. I am always tired of remember things, because I thought if it is important, it will repeat many times in the future and at that time, I must remember these things. However, if I do not remember them once on purpose, I will not remember it at next time I come cross it. I need to start remember something now and it is a good time, because I have already know which things are important enough for me to remember and which are not. This is enough for today. The next thing that I want to do is search some good methods to pick up listening and speaking for a foreign speaker.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[webpack is a module bundler By stating what dependencies a module needs, webpack can use this information to build a dependency graph. It then uses the graph to generate an optimized bundle where scripts will be executed in the correct order. Also unused dependencies will not be included in the bundle. What are loaders?Loaders are transformations that are applied on a resource file of your app. They are functions (running in node.js) that take the source of a resource file as the parameter and return the new source. For example, you can use loaders to tell webpack to load CoffeeScript or JSX.1234567891011121314module: &#123; loaders: [ &#123; test: /\.json$/, include: __dirname + '/client', loader: 'json-loader' &#125;, &#123; test: /\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loaders: ['react-hot', 'babel'] &#125; ]&#125; What is JSXJSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. You can definitely use React without JSX but JSX makes React a lot more elegant. Just like XML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children. If an attribute value is enclosed in quotes, the value is a string. Otherwise, wrap the value in braces and the value is the enclosed JavaScript expression. 123456789101112&lt;div className="red"&gt;Children Text&lt;/div&gt;;&lt;MyCounter count=&#123;3 + 5&#125; /&gt;;// Here, we set the "scores" attribute below to a JavaScript object.var gameScores = &#123; player1: 2, player2: 5&#125;;&lt;DashboardUnit data-index="2"&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Scores&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;Scoreboard className="results" scores=&#123;gameScores&#125; /&gt;&lt;/DashboardUnit&gt;;]]></content>

Be aware that overly nested rules will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and is generally considered bad practice.123456789101112131415nav &#123; ul &#123; margin: 0; padding: 0; list-style: none; &#125; li &#123; display: inline-block; &#125; a &#123; display: block; padding: 6px 12px; text-decoration: none; &#125;&#125; Partials and ImportCSS has an import option that lets you split your CSS into smaller, more maintainable portions. The only drawback is that each time you use @import in CSS it creates another HTTP request. 123456789// _reset.scsshtml,body,ul,ol &#123; margin: 0; padding: 0;&#125; 12345678// base.scss@import 'reset';body &#123; font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: #efefef;&#125; Notice we’re using @import &#39;reset&#39;; in the base.scss file. When you import a file you don’t need to include the file extension .scss. MixinsTo create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name. We’ve named our mixin border-radius. We’re also using the variable $radius inside the parentheses so we can pass in a radius of whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it as a CSS declaration starting with @include followed by the name of the mixin. 12345678@mixin border-radius($radius) &#123; -webkit-border-radius: $radius; -moz-border-radius: $radius; -ms-border-radius: $radius; border-radius: $radius;&#125;.box &#123; @include border-radius(10px); &#125; Extend/InheritanceThis is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. In our example we’re going to create a simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes. 1234567891011121314151617181920.message &#123; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; color: #333;&#125;.success &#123; @extend .message; border-color: green;&#125;.error &#123; @extend .message; border-color: red;&#125;.warning &#123; @extend .message; border-color: yellow;&#125; OperatorsDoing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators like +, -, *, /, and %. In our example we’re going to do some simple math to calculate widths for an aside &amp; article. 123456789101112.container &#123; width: 100%; &#125;article[role="main"] &#123; float: left; width: 600px / 960px * 100%;&#125;aside[role="complementary"] &#123; float: right; width: 300px / 960px * 100%;&#125;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Origin Resourse from Building a Simple CRUD App with React + Redux The advantage of ReactReact is fast. It uses the virtual DOM to track the state of the actual DOM, only re-rendering discrete sections of the DOM as changes to application state dictate. But where I really started to see the advantages of React was in the flow of data through the application, in the purely Data Down Actions Up system of maintaining application state.In React, your components can have both state and properties. A component’s properties should be considered immutable. Instead of a component responding to a user’s action by updating it’s own properties, it will send an action that updates the entire application’s state, which in turn triggers a re-render of a component, updating that component’s properties as a result.]]></content>

You also need to remove the information about the file from Git’s index: These steps will not delete the file from your system. They just tell Git to ignore future updates to the file. Add the file in your .gitignore. Run the following: 1&gt; git rm --cached &lt;file&gt; Commit the removal of the file and the updated .gitignore to your repo.
